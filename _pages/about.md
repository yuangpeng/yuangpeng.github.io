**Research:** As a researcher and engineer specializing in large language model, my primary focus on the development of efficient and scalable methods for multimodal data modeling, with particular emphasis on text, images, and videos. My interest spans multiple ares, including generative modeling, representation learning, reinforcement learning, and embodied AI. My ultimate ambition is to cultivate multimodal perception, reasoning, and generation capabilities for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with the goal of creating fully intelligent systems and robots that can enhance human lives.

**Experience:** I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), advised by [Shutao Xia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=koAXTXgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Bin Chen](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=Yl0wv7AAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I was a research intern at Foundation Model Group, [Megvii Research](https://megvii.com/megvii_research), and [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn). I was a short-term visiting scholar at the Artificial Intelligence Group, [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), advised by [Pietro Li√≤](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4YhNJBEAAAAJ&hl=en). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), where I was recognized as a distinguished graduate and graduated <em>summa cum laude</em>.
